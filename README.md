# PSPDFKit for Web Example - Svelte

This example shows how to integrate [PSPDFKit for Web](https://pspdfkit.com/web/) into a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) app.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- A PSPDFKit for Web license. If you don't already have one
  you can [request a free trial here](https://pspdfkit.com/try/).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-web-example-svelte.git
cd pspdfkit-web-example-svelte
```

Install the project dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
npm i
```

Or yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

Now that everything is installed we need to configure the app to use our [PSPDFKit for Web license key](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/web/current/standalone/integration).

Edit the `.env` file and replace the string `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_GOES_HERE` with the license key that you received via e-mail.

## Running the Example

We are ready to launch the app! ðŸŽ‰

```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

You can now open http://localhost:1234 in your browser and enjoy!
